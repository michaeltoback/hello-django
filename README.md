============

My first project, working toward a full stack

I am taking a course on udemy which is a nice drilldown into web development: www.completewebdevelopercourse.com

I "know" most of this but never took a formal course in it, always self-taught, so I thought the discipline would help me,

I am combining that with my knowledge of Python to showcase what I know. My goal is to combine the entire stack from database up to CSS.
